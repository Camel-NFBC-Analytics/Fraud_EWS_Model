# Fraud Early Warning System (EWS)

## Overview
The **Fraud Early Warning System (EWS)** is a rule-based risk detection model designed to identify **potential fraud signals at an early stage** using defined logic and analytical algorithms.

It enables financial institutions to proactively monitor risk and take preventive actions before losses occur.

**Applicable for:**
- NBFC-MFIs  
- NBFCs  
- Banks

## Objective
- Early identification of fraud-prone accounts, centers, or branches  
- Strengthening proactive risk and audit monitoring  
- Supporting data-driven decision-making  
- Reducing operational and financial risk exposure  

---

## Key Features
- Rule-based and transparent fraud detection logic  
- Early Warning Signals (EWS) generation  
- Risk flagging based on defined thresholds  
- Audit-friendly and explainable model outputs  
- Easy integration with MIS / CSV / Excel data  

---

## Model Approach
1. Input data validation and preprocessing  
2. Application of predefined fraud risk rules  
3. Risk scoring and flag generation  
4. Consolidated EWS output for review and action  

> Note: This is an **Early Warning System**, not a final fraud confirmation tool.
